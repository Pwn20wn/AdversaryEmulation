2. Identify ways to mitigate executed TTPs
3. Utilize common cybersecurity tools to better understand TTPs

Phishing: Spearphishing Link
Commonly Used Port
Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols
    Network Traffic: WireShark (dynamic analysis)

User Execution: Malicious File
    File (maybe Procmon?)

ToDo:
    1. Install WireShark
    2. Install SysInternals
    3. Enable PowerShell Script Block logging

Step 1
    Student powers on VMs / accesses the range environment

Step 2
    Student uses automated scripts to setup .lnk payload

Step 3
    Student sets up WireShark
