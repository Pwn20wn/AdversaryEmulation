The contents in this folder are from the 7-Zip Extra archive found [here](https://www.7-zip.org/a/7z1900-extra.7z).

FIN6 has been found to use 7za.exe, the standalone console Windows executable version of 7-Zip, to compress files before extraction. The rest of the files in this folder are included for completeness of the archive provided by [7-zip.org](7-zip.org).
